# HD_Civilians
"Hmmm, fresh victims for the ever-growing army of the undead..."

This addon spawns civilians that wander around the map, hoping to avoid the hordes of monsters infesting the area. If you manage to reach them before they get slaughtered, pressing Use while standing in front of them will teleport them away to safety, leaving behind some ammo or medical supplies as a reward for rescuing them. 

Civilians can be set to either be friendly or hostile. Friendly civilians will be targeted by monsters, while hostile civilians will be ignored, choosing to side with the demons and running from you instead. If approached, civilians may panic and start flailing about in an attempt to defend themselves from nearby threats. For hostiles, this means you and any other friendlies that intrude on their personal space.

Hostile civilians can also be rescued, but they need to be incapacitated first so they don't resist your attempts to warp them to safety. A few kicks to the shins should do the trick. Those playing with RadTech Weapons loaded will find the Less-Lethal Shotgun and the Stun Gun useful in this regard.

Civilians can either appear naturally around the map, or be set to replace certain monster types entirely. These settings can be useful for creating custom scenarios based around the map types you're playing in, or simply eliminating enemy types you'd rather not have around.

This addon is very much a work-in-progress, so expect bugs and strange behavior. There's still a lot of things I need to include and improve on.
